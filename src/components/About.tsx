  I’m an e-commerce specialist and aspiring software developer based in Miami. I focus on building and improving Shopify stores with large product catalogs, using custom themes, automations, and data tools to make things run more efficiently.<br /><br />
  Day to day, I work on creating theme components for marketing teams, automating product workflows with Shopify Flow, and using tools like Matrixify to manage store data. I enjoy finding ways to simplify processes and improve both the storefront experience and backend operations.<br /><br />
  Lately, I’ve been learning React, Next.js, and Python — especially for automation and web scraping. I’m also exploring low-code tools like n8n and Botpress to test ideas and speed up workflows.<br /><br />
  I like solving practical problems with clean, scalable solutions — and I’m always interested in collaborating on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what Shopify can do.
